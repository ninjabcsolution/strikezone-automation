# CEO One-Pager (Detailed)
## Strikezone: From ERP Data → Best Customers → Look‑Alikes → Pipeline

**What this is:** a simple, executive-friendly explanation of the automation workflow.

---

## 1) What happens (in plain English)

We turn your internal customer data into a repeatable outbound engine.

### Step 1 — Identify your best customers
We ingest your ERP/CRM export (Excel/CSV). Then we answer:
**“Which customers actually make you the most money?”**

We analyze (12–36 months):
- Revenue and gross margin (or closest available proxy)
- Buying frequency and consistency
- Product mix and expansion behavior

### Step 2 — Define what “good” looks like (ICP)
We look for patterns across those best customers to define your real ICP.

Examples of traits:
- Industry types (NAICS/SIC)
- Company size and location
- Buying behavior (how often, how consistently, what mix)
- Operational and financial traits (payment behavior, margin profile)

### Step 3 — Find look‑alike companies
Once we know what your best customers look like, we go find more of them.

We:
- Query external company databases (Apollo; optional LinkedIn/D&B)
- Identify companies that match your ICP traits
- Exclude existing customers and known bad-fit accounts

### Step 4 — Score and prioritize targets
Not all look‑alikes are equal. We rank targets into Tier A/B/C based on:
- How closely they match the ICP
- Their likelihood to buy now (growth/intent signals)
- Strategic importance

### Step 5 — Enrich contacts and personalize outreach
For Tier A and Tier B targets, we:
- Identify the right decision-makers (Procurement, Ops, Plant)
- Generate personalized messaging aligned to industry + use case
- Tailor messaging for win‑back vs net‑new prospects

### Step 6 — Launch outreach and track results
We run multi-touch outreach (email, LinkedIn, phone) and track:
- Replies
- Meetings booked
- Opportunities created

Then we continuously refine targeting based on what converts.

## 2) What the outputs are (what you receive)

You receive tangible outputs your team can use immediately:

### Output A — Top 20% customer list
A ranked list of your highest-value customers (with supporting metrics).

### Output B — ICP summary (1 page)
A simple, data-backed description of what your best customers have in common.

### Output C — Look‑alike company target list
A ranked list of net-new companies that look like your best customers.

### Output D — Tier A/B/C prioritization + “reason codes”
Each target includes **why it was selected**, e.g.:
- “Matches ICP: NAICS 333xxx, 200–500 employees, Midwest footprint”
- “Similar to best customer: ABC Manufacturing (92% similarity)”

### Output E — Enriched decision-makers
For Tier A/B companies:
- Names + titles
- Verified emails/phones (depending on source)
- Org context (who likely owns the decision)

### Output F — Personalized outreach package
For each segment:
- Email sequence drafts
- LinkedIn message drafts
- Call opener script

### Output G — Results dashboard / weekly report
A weekly view of:
- Meetings booked
- Response rates by segment/industry/persona
- Pipeline created
- Learnings to improve the next batch

## 3) Why it matters (ROI)

### 3.1 It focuses your sales team on the highest-probability accounts
Instead of guessing, you target companies that resemble your proven profit drivers.

### 3.2 It reduces manual work dramatically
Without automation, teams spend huge time on:
- pulling reports
- researching accounts
- finding contacts
- writing outreach

This system automates 70–90% of that work, while keeping human approval in the loop.

### 3.3 It turns outbound into a repeatable operating system
Every week you can:
- refresh targets
- launch outreach
- measure results
- improve the model

### 3.4 Practical ROI model (example)

**Assumptions (conservative):**
- 200 Tier A/B accounts targeted per month
- 2–5 decision-makers per account → 400–1,000 contacts
- 3–8% meeting rate (industry varies by list quality)

**Expected outcomes:**
- 12–80 meetings/month depending on volume and ICP quality
- Faster learning loop on what segments convert

**Cost leverage:**
- The system replaces dozens of hours of manual research per rep per month
- Better targeting reduces wasted outreach and increases conversion

---

## 4) What we need from you to start (minimum)

1) **ERP/CRM exports** (CSV/Excel): Customers + Orders (12–36 months)
2) A definition of **gross margin** (field, or revenue + COGS)
3) List of current customers (to exclude from look‑alikes)
4) Tool access (Apollo) and approval of AI usage rules

---

## 5) Timeline to first results

- **Pilot to first outreach:** ~ **2–3 weeks**
- **Full production build:** up to **12 weeks** (with automation + tracking)
